# Royal Gambit – Complete Rules

## Objective
Capture your opponent's King or trap them so they cannot make a legal move (similar to checkmate in chess), but use the powers of playing cards to change the battlefield.

## Equipment
- Standard chessboard and full set of chess pieces (white and black)
- Standard 52-card playing deck (no jokers)

## Setup
1. Set up the chessboard in the normal starting position
2. Shuffle the deck of cards and deal 5 cards to each player as their starting hand
3. Deal an additional 3 cards to each player face-up – these form that player's **Court**
4. Place the remaining deck face-down beside the board

## Game Flow
1. At the start of your turn, draw a card (you should always end your turn with 5 cards in your hand plus 3 in your Court unless stated otherwise)
2. Choose **one action**: either make a chess move OR play a card from your hand OR play a card from your Court (never more than one action in a turn)
3. If you play a card from your Court, immediately replace it from the deck face-up
4. Playing a card means applying its effect immediately, then discarding it (unless replaced in the Court)
5. Making a move follows normal chess rules

## Card Powers

### Hearts (♥) – Rescue
- **Normal Effect**: Move one of your pieces to any empty square
- **Ace Effect**: Move your King out of check even if it breaks normal chess rules

### Diamonds (♦) – Upgrade  
- **Normal Effect**: Promote one pawn to a queen instantly
- **Ace Effect**: Promote any piece to a queen

### Clubs (♣) – Swap
- **Normal Effect**: Swap two of your pieces anywhere on the board
- **Ace Effect**: Swap one of your pieces with an opponent's piece

### Spades (♠) – Strike
- **Normal Effect**: Remove one opponent's piece from the board
- **Ace Effect (Royal Assassin)**: May remove the King only if the King is already in check. If the defending player discards any Spade from their hand immediately, the Ace's effect is blocked. If blocked, the attacker may instead remove any other piece

## Advanced Mechanics

### 1. The Court Hand
Each player has 3 face-up cards called the Court, in addition to their hidden hand of 5 cards. Court cards are public information and can be played instead of a normal move. When a Court card is played, it is immediately replaced from the deck face-up.

### 2. Power Chains
If you play two cards of the same suit in consecutive turns (from either hand or Court), the second card gains a boosted effect:

- **Hearts**: Move two pieces this turn instead of one (can include King if Ace used)
- **Diamonds**: Promote two pawns or one pawn + one other piece (requires Ace for the "other piece")
- **Clubs**: Swap two of your pieces AND swap two of your opponent's pieces
- **Spades**: Remove two opponent pieces instead of one (Ace still follows King-in-check rule)

### 3. The Joust
When a card effect targets an opponent's piece, the defending player may challenge with a face-down card from their hand. Both players reveal simultaneously:

- If the defender's card is higher (Ace is high), the attack is blocked and both cards are discarded
- If the attacker's card is higher, the attack succeeds and both cards are discarded
- If the cards are equal, the attack fails and both cards are discarded

## Special Rules
- If your King is captured by a Strike card without defense, you lose immediately
- If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile
- You may hold cards to block threats or set up attacks, but you can never have more than 5 in your hand plus 3 in your Court

## Strategy Tips
- Balance your moves – playing a card can change the game instantly, but moving your pieces builds long-term advantage
- Use your Court to pressure your opponent with open threats while hiding surprises in your hand
- Break your opponent's Power Chains before they get boosted effects
- In Jousts, bluff with low cards to bait your opponent into wasting high cards
