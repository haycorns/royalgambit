# [Project] Royal Gambit Digital

## 1. What are we trying to accomplish and why?

Create a digital version of Royal Gambit that my mom and I build together and both enjoy playing.

## 2. How will we measure success?

| Success Measure | Baseline | Target | Means of Verification |
|-----------------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Collaborative development success | N/A | We successfully work together through the design-develop-test cycle | Both partners feel good about the collaboration process |
| Game quality | N/A | Final version is fun for both of us | We both want to keep playing after development is "done" |
| Digital adaptation success | N/A | Digital version captures what makes the physical game great | Direct comparison shows digital maintains the fun |

## 3. What other conditions must exist?

| Assumption | Tracking Method | Risk Level |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Mom makes at least one move per week (stays engaged with playtesting) | Track move frequency during testing | Low |
| Royal Gambit translates well from physical to digital format | Compare player experience between physical and digital versions | Medium |

## 4. How will we get there?

**1. Technical Research & Validation (S)**
- Research optimal development platform/tools for asynchronous mobile gameplay
- Validate approach for the most complex game mechanics (Power Chains, Joust, card effects)
- Confirm technical feasibility before major development begins

**2. Asynchronous Digital Royal Gambit Game (L)** *(can be done in parallel with #3)*
- Implements all chess rules correctly (movement, check, checkmate, stalemate)
- Implements all card effects per the rules document (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades with normal and Ace effects)
- Supports Power Chains and Joust mechanics
- Players can take turns asynchronously with no time pressure
- Notification system alerts players when it's their turn (email or text)
- Works reliably on both iOS devices
- Intuitive interface that both you and your mom can navigate easily
- Game state persists between sessions
- Clear visual indication of whose turn it is and what actions are available

**3. Structured Playtesting Process (S)** *(can be done in parallel with #2)*
- Post-game feedback collection system (digital form or simple process)
- Method for tracking what's working vs. what needs adjustment
- Easy way for your mom to communicate rule change suggestions
- Documentation of playtesting sessions and outcomes

**4. End of Project Status Report (S)**
- Verifies both players enjoy the digital version
- Confirms successful collaboration between designer and developer
- Documents lessons learned and potential future improvements

# Stakeholder Analysis
